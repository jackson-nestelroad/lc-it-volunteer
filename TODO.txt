Campus Option
    optional in registration
    can be edited in the search page
        just click to edit on the nametag
            will send another POST request
                will have to rebuild database... don't worry about it
    could we get this data from the official life.church database?
        in RMS?
        Idea
            window.onload (registration) --> pull campus data
            create an option for each campus data (full name) with value of three-letter code
            three-letter code will be stored to the volunteer -- appears on their info modal
            search page (search by campus)
                gives options just like registration page does
